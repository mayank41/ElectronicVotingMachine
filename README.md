# ElectronicVotingMachine
Problem : Design EVM..ie electronic voting system. you have to design classes, interfaces and functions such that it allows users to vote uniquely. if any user votes twice, to different parties you need to report him as a blacklisted person and that person disqualifies for further voting. At last you need to count these votes. And declare the winner. Try to use all OOP concepts so that the design remains the same for all use cases. While designing you can assume few cases. Please note all the assumptions that you take while designing this.
